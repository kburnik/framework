   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Framework's documentation!
=====================================

Framework is a PHP framework aiming to help developers build complete
websites in an MVC fashion without focusing too much on boilerplate.

Most common web application infrastructure like REST APIs, DB abstraction via an
Entity framework, routing, view templates, writing unit tests and other features
are available by using this framework.

In accord with the framework-scaffold project and framework-toolbox, a lot of
development and deployment tasks are done more easily.
